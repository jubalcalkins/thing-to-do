    <ol style="color: blue;">
       <p>France, in Western Europe, encompasses medieval cities, alpine villages<br>
       and Mediterranean beaches. Paris, its capital, is famed for its fashion<br>
       houses, classical art museums including the Louvre and monuments like the Eiffel<br>
       Tower. The country is also renowned for its wines and sophisticated cuisine.<br>
       Lascaux’s ancient cave drawings, Lyon’s Roman theater and the vast Palace<br>
       of Versailles attest to its rich history.</p>
          <li><h2>Eiffel Tower</h2></li>
       <p>The Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This<br>
       structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary<br>
       exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the<br>
       330-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris<br>
       skyline.</p>
          <li><h2>Musée du Louvre</h2></li>
       <p>The most prestigious museum in Paris, the Louvre ranks among the top European<br>
       collections of fine arts. Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are<br>
       found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, the Wedding Feast at Cana<br>
       by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture.
       </p>
          <li><h2>Château de Versailles</h2></li>
       <p>The UNESCO-listed Château de Versailles immerses you in France's glorious regal<br>
       history. Step back in time to the era of the ancien régime, when Louis XIV<br>
       (the "Sun King"), Louis XV, and Louis XVI ruled France. During that period, the<br>
       Palace of Versailles set the standard for princely courts in Europe.
